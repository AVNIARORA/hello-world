# hello-world
Hye! I am a person with a spli-personality syndrome. Sometimes, I can be extremely funny but when I am serious, then I am serious.
This is a project to create a great poetry blog. Ideas are welcome!
I aim to create a content network like quora except the fact that it shall be a hub of great philosophical poetry.
